- Docker compose file and location

- Figure out other containers necessary
- update web dockerfile to exclude docker build files from container
- clear references to old python-slim image
- looks like migrations arent applied unless postgres is 100% up already. look
into delaying web startup (?)
- add other models GET/ Post methods with tests
- add pagination to the django GET / Post methods
